# CHANGELOG

This page documents the changes for the One-Click Level Generator.

## Version 1.1.1

### HotFixes
- Fixed a bug where multiple rivers would be generated at the same location when creating more than two rivers.

### New Features
- Added a button to the OCG Window that assigns a new River Seed and generates a river when clicked.

## Version 1.1.0

### New Features
- Added a feature allowing users to import custom Height Maps to generate terrain.
- Introduced a seed parameter in the river generation logic, ensuring rivers are generated in the same locations for identical seeds.
- Added a layer to prevent PCG content from being generated during level creation, which can be applied via painting in landscape mode.
- Added a Preview Map feature that displays a debug line preview of terrain generated by the current OCG seed.
- Added a Height restriction property for meshes in PCG settings.
- Added an icon to the OCG Window button, accessible from the top Window tab.
- Enhanced the UI to show the progress and tasks being performed at each stage of level generation.
- Added several sample vegetation meshes.
- These meshes now spawn when creating levels using MP_StylizedLandscape.
- Updated the logic for specifying landscape scale, enabling direct input in kilometers.

### Fixed Bugs
- Fixed a crash that occurred when the biome name in OCG settings was set to "None."
- Resolved an issue where regenerating rivers caused irrevocable loss of layer data at biome boundaries.
- Fixed a problem where, with both the OCG Window and MapPreset Editor open, rivers were only generated in the editor's world.
- Fixed an issue where debug points would not appear even when enabled in PCG settings.
- Fixed inconsistent terrain generation with the same seed during initial creation in the OCG Window.
- Fixed a crash that occurred when clearing a MapPreset in the OCG Window.


## Version 1.0.0

- Initial release 🎉
- Added a custom editor and the ability to create MapPreset Assets.
- Added random terrain generation.
